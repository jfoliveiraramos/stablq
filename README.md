# SurfQ

**SurfQ** is a Python framework for efficiently simulating surface codes under noise. The aim is to enable detailed investigation of the behavior of surface codes under different physical error models, supporting advanced fault-tolerant protocols such as lattice surgery, state injection, and magic state distillation as future extensions.

## Features:

- Intuitive surface code representation
- Apply quantum operations: X, Z, H, CNOT, and syndrome measurement
- Simulate various noise channels: Pauli noise, depolarizing, bit-flip, phase-flip errors
- Analyse logical error rates and syndrome measurement statistics for error correction
- Modular and extensible framework for surface code simulation and fault-tolerant quantum protocols
